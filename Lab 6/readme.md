## Career Exploration

#### Tri-C College Central: 
* Register for a student account.
* Use one of the search options such as "Search - Intern Central," take a screenshot of the listings (include your name in the upper right-hand corner in your screenshot,)  name the file: CollegeCentral and upload to your lab folder. 

#### Bureau of Labor Statistics
* I looked into the Bureau of Labor Statistics and researched different coding jobs. The technical job title is called Computer Programmer and they make an average pay of $89,190 dollars a year and it has a -10% decline in growth.


## Industry Certification
* Cisco Certification prepares individuals in dynamic technologies for success in their job paths. Having this certification shows you are a strong candidate for a job with all of the necessary skills to complete the tasks given to you.
## College Certificates
* The certificate of interest that I am looking at is IT Support Professional Certificate. This certificate teaches you about how to be an entry level service technician. This type of certificate teaches you how to service the physical hardware of a computer. All you need is a high school diploma/GED and to take the IT1090 class. The benefits of this certificate are that you get hands on experience, it's job relevant to your major, and it prepares you for the A+ certification exam.


## Professional Membership
* IEEE is a professional association for electronic engineering. The purpose of this organization is to advance technology for the betterment of humanity.
