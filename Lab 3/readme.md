# Executive Summary
In this lab I will be going in depth into the hardware as well as the numeric conversions involved in code.
# Hardware
## Hard Drives and Memory
* Transfer rates in a hard drive refers to the time it takes for data to be transferred from the disk to the system. While latency rates refers to the time it takes for information to be sent from one destination to the next. In a hard drive, you want low latency and high transfer rates.
* A solid state hard drive is much faster than a traditional hard drive. An SSD uses flash memory instead of spinning disks like a traditional hard drive and this is much faster. The SSD is also much smaller and lighter than regular hard drives which is helpful for portable computers. Lastly, since there aren't any moving parts in an SSD they tend to be more reliable than regular hard drives.
* Increasing RAM makes any computer run faster because the working memory aka RAM transfers data much faster than any hard drive or SSD. The only downside is that it's volatile, meaning none of the memory is saved and only works when the computer is running.
* The difference between 64 and 32 bit data paths is the amount of data that can be transferred in a shorter amount of time. 64 bit data paths are newer, faster, and transfer more data in a smaller amount of time compared to 32 bit data paths.

## ALU and Control Unit
* The ALU aka the arithmetic logic unit performs all mathematic operations in the CPU. The ALU also helps the control unit decide what to do next with the information given. The control unit also give the ALU specfic tasks to perform that it is given to by the RAM.

## CPU, Input and Output
* This example addresses CPU, Input, and Output through typing on a keyboard. The first step of the process is Input. The input device is a keyboard and when a key is pressed, it is sent to the CPU to calculate how to depict what keys are pressed. Lastly, the pixel information is sent in Binary to the output device or the computer screen to display what has been inputed and processed.

# Data Representation

## Numeric Conversions
* Explain the difference between decimal, binary and hexadecimal numbers. Decimal number system uses numbers 1 through 9. Binary numbers use only two numbers 0 and 1, the way these numbers are used are through the base of two. Hexadecimal uses a base of 16 and counts to 15. The numbers 10-15 are represented by letters A-F.
* Convert the decimal number 211 to binary showing your work. Number 211 in binary is 11010011. Work shown in screenshot.
* Convert the binary number 101101010 to decimal (show your work). Binary number 101101010 in decimal is 361. Now the binary number wasn't 8 numbers but 9, so I assumed you keep going up from 128 to 256 for the 9th number as shown in my work.
* Convert the decimal number 192 to hexadecimal (show your work) The hexadecimal of 192 is C0.

# Conclusion
I have learned a lot this week. I had a base knowledge about the hardware of computers but this has taught me more in depth. Decimal, binary, and hexadecimal is all very new and very intereseting to me. It's still kind of confusing but I believe over time it will make more sense.
